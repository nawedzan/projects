  time_t now = time(0);
 okay so what is this line doing
ChatGPT
This line of code is capturing the current time in seconds since the Unix epoch (January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC) and storing it in the variable now. Here's a breakdown:

time(0): This is a function call to time() with 0 as its argument. In C and C++, time() is a function from the C Standard Library's <ctime> header, which returns the current time as a time_t value.

time_t now: This declares a variable named now of type time_t, which is a data type typically used to represent time in Unix and POSIX systems.

So, overall, this line retrieves the current time and stores it in the variable now


q: okay so how is it storing that time 
Q: is time_t a library type
Q: what is unix and posix systems and how c++ is related to it
Q: say a program has been compiled how will i store it in varible where even if the program has been cleared from memory the vairbale stays
